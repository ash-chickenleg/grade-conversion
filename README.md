# grade-conversion
A grade conversion project I created for fun to convert between my school district's grading scale and the traditional percentage scale.

In my junior year of high school I had an interesting problem where some of my classes used the traditional percentage scale to determine grades, and some of my classes used the school district's grading scale.
Not only did this make it difficult to understand what my current grade and precise gpa was at any given point in time, but it was even more difficult to explain this situation to my parents.
My solution was this Python file.
This was the first programming project I created purely for myself.
